## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned to use flex to center the content of the page.

Also, I started using flexbox for everything, but it was giving me problems for
the desktop version, so I learned that sometimes it's better to use grid.

### Continued development

I still need more practice with flexbox and I really need to work on
cross-browser compatibility.
